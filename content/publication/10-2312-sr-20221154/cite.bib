Abstract We present a practical method for measurement of spatially varying isotropic surface reflectance of planar samples using a combination of single-view polarization imaging and near-field display illumination. Unlike previous works that have required multiview imaging or more complex polarization measurements, our method requires only three linear polarizer measurements from a single viewpoint for estimating diffuse and specular albedo and spatially varying specular roughness. We obtain high-quality estimate of the surface normal with two additional polarized measurements under a gradient illumination pattern. Our approach enables high-quality renderings of planar surfaces while reducing measurements to a near-optimal number for the estimated SVBRDF parameters.},
