  1 (g) Rendering 2 Figure 1: A planar sample (notebook cover) (a) imaged at near-Brewster
  angle lit by a near-field display (iPad Pro). Polarization-imaging of sample in
  conjunction with controlled display illumination enables estimation of high-quality
  SVBRDF maps (b-e). Rendering of sample with point light from front (f), and 45 •
  from above (g). Abstract We present a practical method for measurement of spatially
  varying isotropic surface reflectance of planar samples using a combination of single-view
  polarization imaging and near-field display illumination. Unlike previous works
  that have required multiview imaging or more complex polarization measurements,
  our method requires only three linear polarizer measurements from a single viewpoint
  for estimating diffuse and specular albedo and spatially varying specular roughness.
  We obtain high-quality estimate of the surface normal with two additional polarized
  measurements under a gradient illumination pattern. Our approach enables high-quality
  renderings of planar surfaces while reducing measurements to a near-optimal number
  for the estimated SVBRDF parameters.'
