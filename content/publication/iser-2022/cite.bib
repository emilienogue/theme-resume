We present a method for measuring bulk optical properties of translucent materials, such as the base inks of a full-color 3D printer. Starting from a thin sample, we measure three spectral intensities: on a black background, white background, and of a collimated light beam. After a fitting step through our precomputed 3D appearance map, we obtain the material's spectrally-varying albedo, extinction coefficient, and phase function anisotropy. We present a spectral measurement approach for the bulk optical properties of translucent materials using only low-cost components. We focus on the translucent inks used in full-color 3D printing, and develop a technique with a high spectral resolution, which is important for accurate color reproduction. We enable this by developing a new acquisition technique for the three unknown material parameters, namely, the absorption and scattering coefficients, and its phase function anisotropy factor, that only requires three point measurements with a spectrometer. In essence, our technique is based on us finding a three-dimensional appearance map, computed using Monte Carlo rendering, that allows the conversion between the three observables and the material parameters. Our measurement setup works without laboratory equipment or expensive optical components. We validate our results on a 3D printed color checker with various ink combinations. Our work paves a path for more accurate appearance modeling and fabrication even for low-budget environments or affordable embedding into other devices.},
