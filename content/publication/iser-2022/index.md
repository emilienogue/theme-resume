abstract: "We present a spectral measurement approach for the bulk optical properties
  of translucent materials using only low-cost components. We focus on the translucent
  inks used in full-color 3D printing, and develop a technique with a high spectral
  resolution, which is important for accurate color reproduction. We enable this by
  developing a new acquisition technique for the three unknown material parameters,
  namely, the absorption and scattering coefficients, and its phase function anisotropy
  factor, that only requires three point measurements with a spectrometer. In essence,
  our technique is based on us finding a three-dimensional appearance map, computed
  using Monte Carlo rendering, that allows the conversion between the three observables
  and the material parameters. Our measurement setup works without laboratory equipment
  or expensive optical components. We validate our results on a 3D printed color checker
  with various ink combinations. Our work paves a path for more accurate appearance
  modeling and fabrication even for low-budget environments or affordable embedding
  into other devices."
