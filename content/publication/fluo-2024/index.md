abstract: Biophysical skin appearance modeling has previously focused on spectral absorption and scattering due to chromophores in various skin layers. In this work, we extend recent practical skin appearance measurement methods employing RGB illumination to provide a novel estimate of skin fluorescence, as well as direct measurements of two parameters related to blood distribution in skin–blood volume fraction, and blood oxygenation. The proposed method involves the acquisition of RGB facial skin reflectance responses under RGB illumination produced by regular desktop LCD screens. Unlike previous works that have employed hyperspectral imaging for this purpose, we demonstrate successful isolation of elastin-related fluorescence, as well as blood distributions in capillaries and veins using our practical RGB imaging procedure.'
